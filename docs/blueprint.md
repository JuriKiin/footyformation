# **App Name**: Footy Formation

## Core Features:

- Player List Management: Add, remove, and edit player names in a list.
- Formation Canvas: A drag-and-drop interface for arranging players on a soccer field.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Grass green (#32CD32), reflecting the field environment.
- Background color: Light green (#E5F8E5), a desaturated version of the primary color for a soft canvas feel.
- Accent color: Red-orange (#FF4500) to highlight interactive elements and buttons, creating a strong contrast.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for player positions and UI controls.
- Divide the screen into a player list area and a larger canvas for the formation, with clear visual separation.
- Smooth transitions when dragging and dropping players on the canvas.
